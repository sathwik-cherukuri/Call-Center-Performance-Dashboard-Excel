# Call-Center-Performance-Dashboard-Excel
Interactive Excel dashboard for analyzing and visualizing business performance metrics.

## Project objective
Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze call center performance, customer satisfaction, and agent efficiency across time, location, and demographics.

## Dataset
- <a href = "https://github.com/sathwik-cherukuri/Call-Center-Performance-Dashboard-Excel/blob/main/excel-portfolio-project.xlsx">Call Center Data</a>

## Question (KPIS)
-Which rep has the highest call volume and revenue?
-What’s the average satisfaction rating by city and gender?
-Which day of the week sees the most calls?
-Do longer calls lead to higher ratings or purchases?
-Which duration bucket yields the most 5-star ratings?

## process
### 1. Data Preparation
Imported raw call center logs containing call details, customer demographics, and satisfaction ratings.

Cleaned and formatted data: handled missing values, standardized column types, and created derived fields like duration buckets and rounded ratings.

### 2. KPI Aggregation
Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) including:

Total calls, total duration, total purchase amount

Average satisfaction rating and count of 5-star calls

Grouped metrics by representative, city, gender, weekday, and duration bucket.

### 3. Dashboard Development
Designed Excel dashboard with pivot tables and charts to visualize:

Monthly and weekday call trends

Agent performance and revenue contribution

Satisfaction distribution across cities and demographics

### 4. Insight Generation
Identified top-performing agents and cities.

Analyzed patterns in customer satisfaction and purchase behavior.

Highlighted operational gaps and improvement areas

## Project Insights
-R02 and R03 handled the most calls and generated the highest revenue.
-1–2 hour calls had the best satisfaction ratings.
-Female customers gave slightly higher ratings than males.
-Most calls occurred on weekends.
-Cleveland had high volume but lower average ratings.

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how to turn raw call center data into meaningful insights using KPIs and dashboards. I was able to track agent performance, customer satisfaction, and revenue patterns across different cities and timeframes. It gave me hands-on experience with data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling — and showed how analytics can actually drive better decisions in real-world scenarios
